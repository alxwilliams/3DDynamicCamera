# 3D Dynamic Camera 

This is my camera prototype, it was also my first 3d model/rig and
animations made with Blender. I should note that the structure of this
game isn't my best, as I was just trying to make a working camera and
get a feel for Blender to Unity exporting.

The controls you'll need to know are pretty simple. Move around with
the left stick and adjust the camera with the right. The left trigger
activates a strafing/targetting mode. The camera naturally follows the
player's movement on its own, but once you start manually controlling
the camera with the right stick, it enters a manual mode that can only
be exited by entering the strafe/targetting mode just link in many
Zelda games.
